# Two-Variable-Diophantine-Linear-Equation-Integer-Solutions

Program finds a general formula, which gives all integer solutions to a two variable diophantine linear equation.

> **How to call function:**

To find all integer solutions to y and x of an equation:

ay = bx + c (a,b,c are constants of type int)

Call:

`DLEITVS(a, b, c)`

> **Returns the solution equation in form:**

x = pn + q

y = rn + s

(where n can be any integer)

The program returns a 2D int array in form: {{p,q}, {r,s}}, i.e. if t is the returned array:

p = t[0][0]

q = t[0][1]

r = t[1][0]

s = t[1][1]

> ***If a solution does not exist, it returns an arithmetic exception**
